        4C Website</h3>
      <p class="bodyText">Any external link located on the 4C website is provided as an 
        information resource to the child care industry and parents without 
        comment or recommendation. While the 4C staff make every effort 
        to verify the existence and appropriateness of any external links, 
        we are not responsible for the efficacy, timeliness, or availability 
        of the content and make no warranty for its accuracy. We stand 
        by the statement made by Tim Berners-Lee (Commentary on Web Architecture, 
        April 1997, <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkLaw"><b>http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkLaw</b></a>) 
        that a link does NOT necessarily imply that</p>
        <div id="list" class="bodyText">
		<ul>
          <li>One document endorses the other; or that </li>
          <li>One document is created by the same person as the other, or 
            that </li>
          <li>One document is to be considered part of another. </li>
        </ul></div>
      <p class="bodyText">4C supports local businesses and organizations and will on occasion 
        provide a link of interest on the website when the content is 
        pertinent to a recent newsworthy topic or upcoming 4C-sponsored 
        event.</p>
      <p class="bodyText">4C does not provide external links to web sites representing 
        individuals or child care programs as this may be misinterpreted 
        as a recommendation. As is stated in all 4C literature:</p>
       <p class="bodyText"><i>4C believes that parents are best able to choose and evaluate 
          child care for their children because they know their children's 
          needs best. Responsibility for selecting child care rests with 
          each parent. A 4C referral does not imply a recommendation. 
          We urge parents to carefully interview and check references 
          before leaving a child in care. If you notice conditions that 
          cause you concern, please call us with the information at 221-0033 
          in Cincinnati or 781-3511 in Northern Kentucky, or send an email 
          to <a href="mailto:4cswo@4cforchildren.org"><b>agency@4cforchildren.org</b></a>.</i></p>
       <h3 class="Heading2"><a name="linkto4c" id="linkto4c"></a> Links to the 4C Website</h3>
       <p class="bodyText">You don't have to ask permission to link to this site -- or any 
        other website. See (Visit the official <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkMyths.html"><b>World 
        Wide Web Consortium</b></a> website for &quot;link myths&quot; on this).</p>
      <p class="bodyText">However, you should never do anything (including making a link) 
        that misrepresents what is being linked to, or implies a relationship 
        with 4C that does not exist. For instance, you may not use misleading 
        frames, URL tricks, or redirections that misrepresent 4C content 
        as being published by anyone other than 4C. Note, this requirement 
        to be clear in your representations is your obligation, 4C does 
        not sign waivers about who may link to us.</p>
      <p class="bodyText">In addition, if 4C discovers the existence of a link that it 
        finds undesirable, we reserve the right to request that the said 
        link be removed.</p>
